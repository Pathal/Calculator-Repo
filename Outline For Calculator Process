Calculator Project:

-We are not going to make the math equations: We will use the math library

-We will make the project in N++

-Click buttons in UI: Works like a scientific calc (TI-84)
	-Syntactic analysis/ parsing


UI
- Div buttons, loose
- CSS to organize


Algorithm
- every object has an evaluate() function
-- "4 + 6 * 2" is 3 objects: (4, 6, sum)
-- "3 * (1*5)" is 6 objects: mult(3, parenth( mult(1, 5) ) )
-- sum's evaluate() returns 

lexical parsing
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis)

- skip whitespace
- use regular expressions to find simple numbers, scientific notation as number nodes
- parenthesis contains a single node
regex list (https://regex101.com/): 
- [0-9,e,.] = number
- 

[0-9,e,.]+
